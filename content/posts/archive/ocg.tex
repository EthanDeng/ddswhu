\section{101 NumPy Exercises for Data Analysis (Python)}


\indent The goal of the numpy exercises is to serve as a reference as well as to get you to apply numpy beyond the basics. The questions are of 4 levels of difficulties with L1 being the easiest to L4 being the hardest.

\noindent\textbf{Question 1}: How to access the response body of requests?\\
\switchocg{ocg1}{\textbf{Show answer}}

\begin{ocg}{Python Code}{ocg1}{1}
\begin{verbatim}
import requests
url = 'www.example.com'
reponse = request.get(url=url).content
print(response)
\end{verbatim}

The goal of the numpy exercises is to serve as a reference as well as to get you to apply numpy beyond the basics \switchocg{ocgridid}{Grid}. The questions are of 4 levels of difficulties with L1 being the easiest to L4 being the hardest  \switchocg{ocstatesid}{States}. If we don't understand \switchocg{ocedgesid}{Edge}.
